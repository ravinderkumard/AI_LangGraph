## Generative AI
Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that can create new content, such as text, images, or music, based on the data they have been trained on. These models use techniques like deep learning and neural networks to generate outputs that are often indistinguishable from human-created content.

LLM based apps like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude are examples of generative AI that can produce human-like text based on prompts provided by users.

Diffusion models are a type of generative model that can create high-quality images by iteratively refining random noise into a coherent image. These models have been used in applications like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion to generate images from textual descriptions.

Code Generation LLMs are specialized language models designed to generate programming code. They can assist developers by suggesting code snippets, completing functions, or even generating entire programs based on natural language descriptions.

TTS models like ElevenLabs and Google TTS convert written text into spoken words. These models use deep learning techniques to produce natural-sounding speech, making them useful for applications like audiobooks, virtual assistants, and accessibility tools.

Video Gen models like Sora and Runway generate video content from textual descriptions or other inputs. These models can create short video clips, animations, or even complex scenes based on user prompts.

## Generative AI Vs Traditional AI:

Traditional AI is about finding patterns in data and giving predictions.
Generative AI is about learning the distribution of data so that it can generate new sample from it.
The best part of GenAI is that it can mimic human-like creativity.

## Application Areas of Generative AI:
1. Content Creation: Generative AI can create articles, blog posts, and marketing copy, helping businesses produce content quickly and efficiently.
2. Software Development: Code generation models can assist developers by generating code snippets, automating repetitive tasks, and even creating entire applications based on user requirements.
3. Customer Support: AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and resolve issues, improving customer satisfaction and reducing response times.
4. Education: Generative AI can create personalized learning materials, quizzes, and interactive content, enhancing the learning experience for students.
5. Design and Art: AI models can generate images, graphics, and designs, assisting artists and designers in their creative processes.
6. Entertainment: Generative AI can create music, videos, and games, providing new forms of entertainment and interactive experiences.
